##Test Engine

## Introduction

The Test Engine is a testing framework designed to facilitate the execution and verification of test cases using annotations. This project aims to enhance the functionality of the Test Engine by introducing annotations that correlate with expected test outcomes and by improving the overall user experience through informative ASCII art branding and clear display of test results.

## Features

- **Enhanced Annotations:** The Test Engine now supports annotations that allow the specification of expected test outcomes. This enhancement enables more comprehensive testing scenarios and facilitates the verification of test results.

- **Test Result Verification:** After executing each test, the Test Engine verifies whether the actual test result matches the expected outcome. Test results can be categorized as `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `ERROR` based on their correctness and exception handling.

- **Informative Branding:** The Test Engine displays its name in ASCII art format, providing a visually appealing and memorable representation. This branding adds a personal touch to the testing experience.

- **Clear Test Information:** Before executing tests, the Test Engine provides clear information about the available tests, including their names and descriptions. This ensures that users have a comprehensive understanding of the testing scope.

- **Detailed Test Results:** After completing test execution, the Test Engine displays detailed information about the results of each test, including whether it passed, failed, or encountered an error. This allows users to quickly identify any issues and take appropriate action.

- **Optional Progress Display:** The Test Engine optionally provides a progress indicator during test execution, allowing users to track the progress of test execution and estimate remaining time.

## Usage

The Test Engine provides a user-friendly interface for executing and monitoring test cases. Users can create and annotate test methods with expected outcomes, allowing the Test Engine to verify test results automatically. Sample test cases and execution scripts are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the Test Engine.

## Conclusion

The enhanced Test Engine offers a robust and user-friendly solution for automated testing, providing comprehensive support for test result verification and clear presentation of test outcomes. With its intuitive interface and informative features, the Test Engine streamlines the testing process and helps users ensure the quality and reliability of their software projects.
